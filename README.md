# kinaschs Advent of Code 2025
My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) exercises/days.

## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): [>3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3717/)
  - Most of the code was written and executed using Python [3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)

## Usage

Execute the scripts using the project's Powershell Script while in repos root folder (Windows-only, tracks execution time):
```ps1
> .\run.ps1 <day_number> [input_file]
```
- Example running day with the examples from the days (test):
```ps1
> .\run.ps1 1 test
```
  
Executing it via `python -m day_x.main [input_file]` is also possbile and platform independent.
